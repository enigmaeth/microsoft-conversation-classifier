NBSVM was introduced by Sida Wang and Chris Manning in the paper [Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classiﬁcation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sidaw12_simple_sentiment.pdf). In this kernel, we use sklearn's logistic regression, rather than SVM, although in practice the two are nearly identical (sklearn uses the liblinear library behind the scenes).\n",
